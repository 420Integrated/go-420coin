      "description": "A mining flaw could cause miners to erroneously calculate PoW, due to an index overflow, if DAG size is exceeding the maximum 32 bit unsigned value.\n\nThis occurred on the Ethereum Classic(ETC) chain on 2020-11-06. This would possibly trigger on the 420coin mainnet at approximately block `11550000`/epoch `385`, slated to occur late April 2026.\n\nThis issue is relevant only for miners, non-mining nodes are unaffected, since non-mining nodes use a smaller verification cache instead of a full DAG.",
